## Overview

[Web Project Template](https://github.com/PinoleroMedia/web-project-template) is a template to quick start a web project it is based on google [web starter kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit) so it offers many of the same benefits as that kit, but this one come with bower and wiredep already pre-configured and no initial html markup.

## Quickstart

[Download](https://github.com/PinoleroMedia/web-project-template/releases/latest) the kit or clone this repository and build on what is included in the `app` directory.

Be sure to look over the [installation docs](docs/install.md) to verify your environment is prepared to run WSK.
Once you have verified that your system can run WSK, check out the [commands](docs/commands.md) available to get started.



## A Boilerplate-only Option

If you would prefer not to use any of our tooling, delete the following files from the project: `package.json`, `gulpfile.babel.js`, `.jshintrc` and `.travis.yml`. You can now safely use the boilerplate with an alternative build-system or no build-system at all if you choose.
